# React Native FlatList Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component renders an empty list even after a successful API call and the component state is populated with data.  The issue likely stems from improper handling of asynchronous operations or data updates within the component's lifecycle.  A solution is provided to address this problem. 

## Bug Description
The `DataList` component fetches data from an API and updates its state. Despite the data being correctly fetched and stored in the state, the `FlatList` remains empty. This issue may occur due to improper handling of asynchronous operations or state updates within the component lifecycle.  Debugging steps were taken using console logs to confirm the data was properly fetched. This was verified.

## Solution
The solution ensures that the FlatList re-renders when the data state changes.
